# @cap-sf-sdk/core

> Complete SuccessFactors SDK for SAP Cloud Application Programming Model.

This is the meta-package that provides access to all CAP SuccessFactors SDK tools in one convenient install. It was previously located at `packages/sdk` and has been renamed to `packages/core` to avoid confusion.

All usage remains the same:

```bash
npm install @cap-sf-sdk/core
```

Refer to the monorepo root README for full details.
